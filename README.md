Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can challenge an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. Test your skills and see if you can outsmart the AI!

## Overview

This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where users can play against an AI opponent. The AI is designed to be unbeatable, ensuring that every game provides a challenging experience.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to ensure optimal moves.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on various devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Interactive Interface**: Enjoy a user-friendly interface with smooth transitions and clear feedback.

## Getting Started

### How to Play

1. **Game Rules**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on an empty square.
2. **Objective**: The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. **Draw**: If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game is considered a draw.

### AI Mechanics

- **Minimax Algorithm**: This algorithm evaluates all possible moves to determine the best possible outcome for the AI.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by eliminating branches that don't need to be explored, making the AI faster and more efficient.

## Technical Details

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Implementation**: The AI is implemented using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize its decision-making process.
- **Project Structure**:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game interface.
  - `style.css`: Styles for the game layout and design.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript logic for game mechanics and AI functionality.

## Development
